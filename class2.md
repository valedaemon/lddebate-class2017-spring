# Cases and Cross-Examination

## Cases
On first blush, cases are similar to essays. They have an introduction, several points, and a conclusion. However, while essays 
must prioritize supporting a central thesis, a case must negate or affirm the resolution at hand through the value that is 
advocated which in turn is interpreted through the lens of a criterion.

### Introduction
The opening line can be as simple as "I stand before you to affirm|negate the resolution, '<resolution>.'" However, as with the
National Forensics League itself, introductions can be your bread and butter. Citing an example, an ancedote, or a piece of
research will go a long way to prove to the judge and your opponent that you are prepared and ready to win.

Next define your terms. Most if not all resolutions use ambiguous terms that will need to be defined. Oftentimes, a debate can
boil down to how a side defined a term. Pay close attention to the definitions used by the opponent.

After stating the resolution, the time is now to state your value and criteria/ion. 

Finally, you can state your contentions.

### Contentions
A contention is a self-contained argument, just like a point one may make in an essay. Affirmative cases typically have three to
four points and negative cases two to three. The point here is not to try to cram a ton of superficial contentions into a case
like one may do in a CX debate. Rather, depth is what's needed. A contention can be divided up into several subpoints if needed.

### Conclusion
The poor conclusion. It is often the most misunderstood of a proper debate case or a paper. Many students simply rehash everything
that has already been said. While it is important to sum up a case, the best conclusions will restate everything in such a way
that it sheds new light. For example, citing an example which utilizes all the points or by adding in a new dimension.

### Cross Examination
CX is the two periods in a debate round where the two speakers clash directly. The questioner will attempt to contest points in 
your case and/or bring up topics which will harm your arguments. The person being questioned will attempt to use up the questioner's
time and strengthen their own position.

CX is governed by a few principles: diplomacy, time management, and clash.

## Class Resolution
For this class, we will be debating one resolution:

## Resolved: Just societies should never deliberately initiate war.
