## Flowing
Flowing is name given to the fine art of note-taking within an LD debate round. The term gets its name from the linear progression and how arrows either link arguments together or demonstrate how an argument was dropped. See the below image for illustration. Flowing is of the utmost importance as it serves as both a 50,000 foot overview of the round in addition to providing all of the details you'll need as you progress through it.

In a perfect round, the flow will look like the above where each argument is captured and is then rebutted in kind through each phase of the debate. However, rarely is a round or a flow perfect. Your opponent (or perhaps even you) may neglect to argue against a point. When that happens, that argument is "flowed" all the way through.

### In debate, silence means consent.

Once a debator drops an argument, then he or she has effectively agreed with the point and can no longer argue against it. On the flow, the arrow that follows that point is then drawn all the way to the end of the page to denote that point.

The image above is only a suggestion. There are numerous templates available on the web. The most common way of flowing though is to bring a 8x14 legal pad and use it in landscape orientation.

## Writing Cases
A debator needs both an affirmative and a negative case as the organizers of the debate will determine not only whom you will debate but also which side. While there are many methods for writing cases, here are two obvious ones:

* Bottom-up approach: Think of any and all arguments you possibly can regarding the resolution. Once you have a list, organize them into for and against categories. Then look for values and criteria that link major arguments together.
* Top-down approach: Think of a value and criteria that fits the resolution well. Then come up with contentions that support them.

Remember that affirmative cases need to be six minutes in length. The negative is a little more fluid as the seven minutes speaking time has to be divided into both the reading of the case and arguing against the affirmative. A good rule of thumb is 3-3:30 minutes.

## Other items to prepare
* An Argument List: Continue onward from the bottom-up approach described above. Think of any and all arguments concerning the resolution. Write them down. Then note strategies on how to defeat those points. When you encounter a new argument in tournaments, write them down!
* A CX List: What questions will support your case? What questions can tear down the opposing side? Come up with great CX questions and keep a running total. When you see a new line of argumentation, write it down!
